# Age_Gender_Prediction
Created a deep learning project-Image Classification Model for the gender prediction and  a regression model for the age prediction. The Objective of the project is to detect Gender and Age using facial images at different poses. The  Model used is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Feature Extraction and the results are shown in graphs.The Objective of the project is to detect Gender and Age using facial images at different poses.The Model used is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Feature Extraction and visualize the results with graphs and to classify the images. There are mainly 2 outputs namely, Gender(Male or Female) and Age.The evolving of ideas helps in figuring certain boundaries. Age assessment is a multi-class issue in which the years; are categorized into classes. Individuals of various ages have various facials, so it is hard to assemble the pictures.

DATASET DESCRIPTION
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.
The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(M or F) and age.

In conclusion, the age and gender prediction model using CNNs is a powerful tool that can accurately predict the age and gender of an individual from facial images. The use of deep learning algorithms and CNNs allows the model to learn and extract features from the images, improving its accuracy and reducing the need for manual feature engineering. The proposed approach of using a CNN architecture for the age and gender prediction model involves several steps, including data preprocessing, designing the CNN architecture, and training the model on a large dataset. Once the model is trained, it can make predictions on new facial images with high accuracy. The computational technique used in the age and gender prediction model is based on the principles of deep learning, which involve the use of large datasets and complex neural networks to learn and make predictions. The use of CNNs allows the model to analyze images and extract features that are relevant to predicting age and gender, improving its accuracy and robustness
